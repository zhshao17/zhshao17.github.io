# ðŸŒŸ About Me

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate students at [School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation(AIA)](http://english.aia.hust.edu.cn/index.htm), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/)(HUST). 

My research interest includes optimization theory in deep learning and reinforcement learning. I also follow computer graphics, that's interesting.

Previously, I worked on low-level image processing techniques, visit the [Github](https://github.com/zhshao17/Defocus-blur-detection) for details.
